    </div>
    <ul class="left-list">
        <li>Communicate online like you would face to face</li>
        <li>Acknowledge that we're all still learning</li>
        <li>Diversity matters and starts with individual acceptance of difference</li>
        <li>When explaining, think back to when you were learning and explain it to yourself back then</li>
        <li>Empathy is crucial and should be practiced mutually during interactions with collaborators</li>
    </ul>
