                <p>We often forget about the <b>human</b> component of software in the industry.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of criticisms that tech is a self-perpetuating bubble and unfortunately it is certainly on its way there.</p>
                <p>Things I try to bring to software:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Communicate online like you would face to face<b></li>
                    <li><b>Acknowledge that we're all still learning<b></li>
                    <li><b>Diversity matters and starts with individual acceptance of difference<b></li>
                    <li><b>When explaining, think back to when you were learning and explain it to yourself back then<b></li>
                    <li><b>Empathy is learned and should be mutually practiced in interactions with collaborators<b></li>
